“A TRIBUTE TO MARIO”
1.	Problem Description 

	The site I created is a tribute to Mario a character in a Mario video game franchise owned by Nintendo. I’ve a lot of childhood memories with Mario hence, I thought this would be the best time to create something nostalgic for myself. Moreover, most of my friends and the kids I know love Mario hence this website is for everyone who loves videogames. This website typical lets you know the origin of Mario, what games one should never miss from Mario franchise and most interesting of all, allows you to play games online instead of buying or downloading on PC allowing you to save some memory.
