_**“A TRIBUTE TO MARIO”**_
1.	Problem Description 

The site I created is a tribute to Mario a character in a Mario video game franchise owned by Nintendo. I’ve a lot of childhood memories with Mario hence, I thought this would be the best time to create something nostalgic for myself. Moreover, most of my friends and the kids I know love Mario hence this website is for everyone who loves videogames. This website typical lets you know the origin of Mario, what games one should never miss from Mario franchise and most interesting of all, allows you to play games online instead of buying or downloading on PC allowing you to save some memory.

2.	Research

a) To begin with I was totally blank with regards to what should be my highlight of my project. Then I googled “HTML project ideas for beginners” then on www.upgrad.com I read about multiple topics however, the tribute page outstands the most. I knew I wanted to create a webpage but was not sure for whom? Then after a day I can to a conclusion I’ll create a page for our very favourite Mario. <br />
b) My page is inspired from the following page www.character-stats-and-profiles.fandom.com/wiki/Mario_(Canon)/SuperNintendude <br />
c) Most of the information/content on the page is from Wikipedia. The images are from www.google.com the videos 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are embedded from YouTube from channels like Nintendo UK, Video Detective, bdrumerdrums, Playscope trailers, and Nintendo respectively.<br />
d) The content for top 5 must try games are from www.wired.co.uk <br />
e) The games on games page are embedded from www.funhtml5games.com  <br />
f) The png files are from www.pngarts.com  <br />


3.	Technology Selection and Site Architecture 

a) HTML5  and CSS3 is used <br />
b) The preferred usage of website is through PC. As it allows the user to conveniently play the games. However, the responsive design allows the user to use view the website on different devices.<br />
c) The css is used in em and % creating a responsive design.<br />


5.	Development Plan 

a) First of all the wireframe of all the pages is developed. Following trial and error method. <br />
b) Secondly, all the resources are gathered such as images, videos, content, sources to embed and are saved in appropriate subfolders in assets.<br />
c) Thereafter the first main html home page is created all the common CSS rules to be used are segregated hence giving the same class and id name to the respective section. This allows the developer to reuse CSS code. For example, background colour, same footer, similar font-family, size width.<br />
d) The relative path is given to the images file.<br />
e) Iframe is downloaded for the resources to be embedded. For instance, in this website, YouTube videos and games are embedded.<br />

6.	Testing Plan 

a) JS file is used to validate the contact page and the comment section. The date attribute was not allowing the user to select from the dropdown menu after the popup error hence, the date input was changed to required.<br />
b) The contact page displays that the data has been successfully updated one the validation is completed.<br />
c) I tried to use it in multiple browsers like mozilla, explorer and crome and it was supported in all of them.<br />
